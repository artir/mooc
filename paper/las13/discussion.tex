\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}
In this work we took a first step towards understanding student engagement and its impact on student performance using data-driven methods. We formalize, using PSL, our intuition that student engagement can be modeled as a complex interaction of behavioral, linguistic and social cues, and show that our model can construct an interpretation for the latent engagement types from data, without supervision, based on their impact on final performance. 

In addition to our empirical results, we provide some qualitative results of possible uses of the learned engagement-classes. While not comprehensive, it demonstrates the direction of our future work---facilitating instructors' intervention when needed, based on identifying user groups and the sentiment emerging from their forum content.
